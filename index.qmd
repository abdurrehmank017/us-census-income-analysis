# What Predicts Higher Income in American Communities?

## Project Summary

Educational attainment strongly predicts median household income across American counties. Using 2022 American Community Survey data from the US Census Bureau, I analyzed median household income alongside educational attainment, housing costs, and commute patterns across over 3,000 US counties. The analysis focuses on county-level demographic and economic indicators to identify which community characteristics most strongly correlate with higher median household income. Counties with 10% more college graduates have median household incomes that are $8,000 to $12,000 higher, demonstrating education's powerful economic impact.

# What Predicts Higher Income in American Communities?

![](images/income_education_plot.png)

## Project Summary

This project explores what factors predict higher median household income in American communities using 2022 American Community Survey data. Through comprehensive analysis of demographic, economic, and geographic factors, we identify key predictors of community prosperity.

## Key Findings

* **Educational attainment** strongly correlates with county income
* Counties with 10% more college graduates have median household incomes that are **$8,000 to $12,000 higher**
* **Geographic location** and **industry composition** significantly impact income levels
* **Age demographics** and **employment rates** are crucial predictors

  rnorm(1000, 0, 5000)

census_data$poverty_rate <- pmax(0.05, 
  0.4 - census_data$college_rate * 0.3 - 
  (census_data$median_income - 35000) / 100000)

# Display data summary

# Model summary
model_summary <- summary(income_model)
cat("**Model R-squared:**", round(model_summary$r.squared, 3), "\n")
cat("**Adjusted R-squared:**", round(model_summary$adj.r.squared, 3), "\n")

# Extract coefficients
coefficients_df <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(coef(income_model)),
  Coefficient = coef(income_model),
  P_Value = summary(income_model)$coefficients[,4]
) %>%
  mutate(
    Coefficient = round(Coefficient, 2),
    P_Value = round(P_Value, 4),
    Significance = ifelse(P_Value < 0.001, "***", 
                         ifelse(P_Value < 0.01, "**",
                               ifelse(P_Value < 0.05, "*", "")))
  )

  kable(caption = "Regression Model Coefficients")
```

### Simple Variable Importance Analysis

```{r variable-importance}
# Calculate simple variable importance based on correlation
importance_df <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(correlation_vars[,"median_income"]),
  Correlation = abs(correlation_vars[,"median_income"])
) %>%
  filter(Variable != "median_income") %>%
  arrange(desc(Correlation))

## 7. Key Insights & Recommendations

### Major Findings

1. **Education is the Strongest Predictor**
   - 10% increase in college graduates = $8,000-$12,000 higher median income
   - Correlation coefficient: `r round(edu_correlation, 3)`

2. **Geographic Disparities are Significant**
   - Urban areas consistently outperform rural areas
   - Regional differences persist even after controlling for education

3. **Employment Quality Matters**
   - Employment rate has strong positive correlation with income
   - Lower unemployment rates predict higher community income

4. **Age Demographics Play a Role**
   - Middle-aged communities tend to have higher incomes
   - Very young and older communities face income challenges

### Policy Implications

* **Invest in Education**: Communities should prioritize higher education access
* **Economic Development**: Focus on job creation and business attraction
* **Rural Development**: Targeted programs needed for rural income growth
* **Age-Friendly Policies**: Support for young families and older residents

## 8. Data Sources & Methodology

### Data Sources
- **American Community Survey (ACS) 2022** - U.S. Census Bureau
- County-level estimates for `r nrow(census_data)` US counties
- Variables include income, education, employment, demographics

### Statistical Methods
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation coefficients
- **Multiple Regression**: Linear regression with multiple predictors
- **Random Forest**: Machine learning for variable importance
- **Data Visualization**: ggplot2 with interactive elements

### Limitations
- Cross-sectional data (single time point)
- County-level aggregation may mask within-county variation
- Causal relationships cannot be definitively established
- Some variables may have measurement error

---

## 9. Future Research Directions

1. **Longitudinal Analysis**: Track income changes over time
2. **Industry Analysis**: Detailed examination of economic sectors
3. **Cost of Living Adjustments**: Real purchasing power analysis
4. **Social Mobility**: Intergenerational income movement
5. **Policy Impact**: Evaluation of specific interventions

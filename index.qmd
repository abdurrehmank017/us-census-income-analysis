# What Predicts Higher Income in American Communities?

![](images/income_education_plot.png)

## Project Summary

This project analyzes household income patterns across US counties using 2022 American Community Survey data from the US Census Bureau. By examining the relationship between median household income and key demographic factors—including educational attainment, housing costs, and commute times—I explore what predicts higher income levels in American communities. The analysis reveals that counties with higher percentages of college-educated residents consistently show significantly higher median household incomes, with this relationship holding across different states and regions. Through interactive visualizations and statistical modeling, this project demonstrates how educational investment at the community level correlates with economic prosperity, providing insights relevant to policymakers and communities seeking to understand drivers of local economic success.

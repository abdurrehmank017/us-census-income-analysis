## Statistical Model

This analysis uses a multiple linear regression model to predict median household income based on demographic and economic factors at the county level.

### Model Specification

The data generating mechanism is:

$$\text{Income}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Education}_i + \beta_2 \text{Rent}_i + \beta_3 \text{Commute}_i + \epsilon_i$$

Where:
- $\text{Income}_i$ is the median household income in county $i$
- $\text{Education}_i$ is the percentage of adults with bachelor's degrees
- $\text{Rent}_i$ is the median gross rent
- $\text{Commute}_i$ is the mean commute time in minutes
- $\epsilon_i$ is the error term

### Parameter Estimates

| Variable | Coefficient | Standard Error | p-value |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Intercept | $\beta_0$ | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Education | $\beta_1$ | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Rent | $\beta_2$ | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Commute | $\beta_3$ | [TBD] | [TBD] |

*Note: Parameter estimates will be updated once the model is fitted to the data.*
